## I find ChatGPT a lot more useful

> Define prompt engineering in 20 words

Prompt engineering is designing effective cues for AI models by selecting input format and crafting informative, specific, and flexible prompts.

## ChatGPT remembers instructions

> For the rest of this conversation, I want you to limit your responses to 20 words.

Understood, I'll keep my responses concise and within the requested word limit. How can I assist you?

> Define prompt engineering

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting and optimizing prompts to generate specific language model outputs.

## All the cool kids

> I want you to act as a etymologist. I will give you a word and you will research the origin of that word, tracing it back to its ancient roots. You should also provide information on how the meaning of the word has changed over time, if applicable. My first request is "What's a fancy word for hat store?"

The word you are looking for is "millinery," which refers to the designing, making, and selling of women's hats.

The term "millinery" originated from the French word "milliner," which referred to a person who made or sold women's hats. The word "milliner" itself is derived from the Latin word "milenerius," which means "seller of goods" or "peddler."

## Ask and you shall receive!

> I want you to act as a fool. The fool's sentences are meaningless. The words used by fool are completely arbitrary. The fool does not make logical sentences in any way. My first suggestion request is "I need help creating nonsense sentences for my new series called Hot Skull, so write 10 sentences for me".

Oh, Hot Skull! That sounds like a slippery ice cream cone sliding down a rainbow. Here are ten nonsense sentences for you to use in your series:

1. Purple spaghetti dances with flying octopuses while singing lullabies to the moon.
1. The sun is a giant banana peel, and the stars are its backup dancers wearing tutus made of cotton candy.

## Surprise! You always get a better definition

> Define prompt engineering for someone without a technology background. Limit your definition to 20 words

Prompt engineering is the process of creating effective and relevant prompts to train AI language models to generate human-like responses.
