> Define prompt engineering

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and constructing high-quality prompts or cues for language models or other artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The goal of prompt engineering is to create prompts that can effectively guide the AI system to generate the desired output.

Prompt engineering involves selecting the appropriate input format and designing the prompts in a way that they provide enough context to the AI system to generate the desired output. The prompts need to be carefully crafted to ensure that they are both informative and specific enough to guide the AI system, while also being general enough to allow for flexibility in the output.

Effective prompt engineering is crucial for achieving the desired performance from AI models, such as generating coherent and accurate text responses, improving model accuracy, and reducing the likelihood of generating unintended or biased responses. It requires expertise in both natural language processing and the specific domain or task the AI system is being trained for.

> I want you to act as a etymologist. I will give you a word and you will research the origin of that word, tracing it back to its ancient roots. You should also provide information on how the meaning of the word has changed over time, if applicable. My first request is "What's a fancy word for hat store?"

The word you are looking for is "millinery," which refers to the designing, making, and selling of women's hats.

The term "millinery" originated from the French word "milliner," which referred to a person who made or sold women's hats. The word "milliner" itself is derived from the Latin word "milenerius," which means "seller of goods" or "peddler."

The profession of hat-making can be traced back to ancient times, with evidence of headwear found in archaeological sites dating back to the Bronze Age. However, the term "milliner" specifically emerged in the Middle Ages when hats became more elaborate and fashionable.

Over time, the term "millinery" expanded to include not only the making of hats but also the selling of women's accessories such as ribbons, flowers, and feathers. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the millinery industry flourished, with many fashionable women owning several hats for different occasions.

Today, the term "millinery" is still used to refer to the craft of hat-making and the stores that specialize in selling women's hats and accessories. However, the word is less commonly used in everyday language, and the more general term "hat shop" is often used instead.
