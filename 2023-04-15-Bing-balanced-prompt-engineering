Prompt engineering is a concept in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly natural language processing (NLP). It is the practice of designing and refining the input provided to models such as ChatGPT, GPT-3, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, or any other generative AI model³. In plain English, prompting is the process of instructing an AI to do a task. We tell the AI a set of instructions, and it performs the task based on those instructions¹. Prompt engineering can vary in complexity from a phrase to a question to multiple paragraphs worth of text¹.

Here are three brief examples of prompt engineering:
1. A prompt for a chatbot that helps customers order food might be "I want to order pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms."
2. A prompt for an AI that generates images might be "Draw a cat wearing a hat and playing with a ball of yarn."
3. A prompt for an AI that generates text might be "Write a story about a detective who solves a murder case in New York City."²

Prompt engineering is a concept in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly natural language processing (NLP). It involves the design and development of prompts that serve as inputs for AI models and help in training the models to address specific tasks¹. In prompt engineering, the description of the task that the AI is supposed to accomplish is embedded in the input, e.g., as a question, instead of it being implicitly given². Prompt engineering typically works by converting one or more tasks to a prompt-based dataset and training a language model with what has been called "prompt-based learning" or just "prompt learning"².

I hope this definition helps you! Let me know if you have any other questions.
